## Problem Domain:
<p>
  AI Solutions for Industrial and Societal Problems.
</p>
  
## Description
<p>
  Concrete cracking is a major issue in Bridge Engineering. Detection of cracks facilitates the design, construction and maintenance of bridges effectively.
</p>

## Requirement Specification:
  - Use open source dataset (From the link: https://cutt.ly/PS_1_dataset).
  - Develop a suitable Deep Learning framework which can detect the crack in the image from the dataset.
  - Transfer Learning based DL framework would be appreciated.

## Judging Metrics: 
<p>
  Provide Precision, Recall and F1 score as Judging metrics
</p>
